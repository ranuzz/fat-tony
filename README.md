## Fat Tony

Named after the beloved Simpsonâ€™s character, Fat Tony is our attempt to bring the classic and immensely popular social deduction game, Mafia (also known as werewolves) online. The game models a conflict between two groups: an informed minority, and an uninformed majority. We are huge fans of the game and end up regularly playing it within our social circle. It encourages social engagement and is intellectually stimulating. In these unprecedented times of social distancing, we believed that we all could do with a game of Mafia, that aims to brings us together. Facilitated through video chat, complete with eyeball tracking and live voting it is a one-of-its-kind-experience. Do try it out !
